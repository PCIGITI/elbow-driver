<MANUAL_JOINT_CONTROL>

Use this panel to jog joints manually.

Modes:
- MODE: DEGREES
  • Enter a degree delta in VALUE.
  • [+]/[-] buttons move the selected joint by that amount.
  • Updates the Cumulative Position display.
- MODE: STEPS
  • VALUE is motor steps (integer).
  • [+]/[-] buttons send raw step counts.
  • Does not update Cumulative Position.

INDIVIDUAL_MOTOR_CTRL (STEPS only):
- Off = coordinated joint motion (paired motors driven together).
- On  = move a single motor channel at a time.

Joints:
- Q1 = Elbow Pitch
- Q2 = Elbow Yaw
- Q3 = Wrist Pitch
- Q4L/Q4R = Left/Right Jaw
  • In JAWS mode: jaws open/close.
  • In WRIST_YAW mode: both jaws move together to yaw wrist.

Notes:
- Positive/negative direction follows Sign Conventions.
- Use small increments to test motion safely.

Sign convention is according to the physical robot:

Q1+ South
Q2+ East
Q3+ South
Q4+ Open
