This panel controls high-level system behaviors.

VERBOSITY: OFF / ON
Toggles detailed feedback from the Arduino. When ON, the Arduino will send more information about its state and actions to the OUTPUT_LOG. This is useful for debugging, and detrimental for real time control.

MODE: JAWS / WRIST_YAW
This toggle changes the function of the Q4 motors.

In JAWS mode, the Q4L and Q4R controls open and close the left and right jaws independently.

In WRIST_YAW mode, the Q4L and Q4R motors work together to produce a yawing motion of the wrist.
