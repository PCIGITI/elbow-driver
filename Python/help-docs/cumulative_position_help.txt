<CUMULATIVE_POSITION>
This section shows the GUI’s running estimate of joint angles 
(in degrees) for all axes:

   Elbow Pitch (EP)
   Elbow Yaw (EY)
   Wrist Pitch (WP)
   Left Jaw (LJ)
   Right Jaw (RJ)

How it updates:
- Increases/decreases after DEGREE-based moves or ROS commands.
- Step-mode jogs (raw motor steps) do NOT change these numbers.
- Angles are initialized to 90.0° (neutral reference) on startup 
  or reset.

[RESET_POSITION]
- Resets all displayed values back to 90.0°.
- Do this after physically rehoming your motor. 

Notes:
- These are GUI-side values, not encoder feedback.
- Signs and offsets follow the GUI’s sign convention settings.
- Useful for tracking relative moves and sanity-checking ROS commands.
