<ROS_INTERFACE>

Enable ROS-based control by subscribing to a JointState topic.

ROS_MODE
- Toggles the ROS controls (requires rospy installed).

TOPIC
- Enter the /sensor_msgs/JointState topic (e.g. /cccleft11/joint_states).
- Click [SUBSCRIBE] to start/refresh the subscriber.

FREQ (ms)
- How often the GUI drains the incoming ROS queue.
- Lower = more responsive updates (higher CPU).

Status
- Shows Ready/Subscribing/Inactive. Check the OUTPUT LOG to confirm
  successful subscribe and data reception.

How data is interpreted
- Incoming radians are converted to degrees and shifted by +90° to match
  the GUI frame; signs are applied per code (Q1 inverted, Q2/Q3 shifted,
  jaws mirrored).
- The GUI computes angle deltas from the current CUMULATIVE_POSITION and
  executes a coordinated move.

IMPORTANT
- WARNING: BE SURE YOUR CUMULATIVE_POSITION TAB IS ACCURATE BEFORE
  SUBSCRIBING VIA ROS!
- Recommended: disable verbose output for faster real-time control.

Notes
- Expected joint names in incoming messages:
  elbow_pitch, elbow_yaw, wrist_pitch, jaw_1
- If topic/joint names don’t match, messages are ignored.
