<TENSION_MOTORS>

Individually adjust cable/tendon tension on specific motors.

Step Size
- Integer number of motor steps applied per button press.

Buttons per motor [3]…[8]
- D  = “Release” tension  → sends +StepSize steps
- T  = “Tighten” tension  → sends −StepSize steps
- Each press only affects the labeled motor; all others get 0.

What gets sent
- The GUI builds MOVE_ALL_MOTORS:<s1,...,s8> with zeros everywhere
  except the selected motor. Example for motor 5 with StepSize=10 and
  “T”: 0,0,0,0,-10,0,0,0

Mapping / indices
- Motor labels are 1-based; command array is 0-based.
- Motors 3–8 correspond to indices 2–7 in the MOVE_ALL_MOTORS list.

Display / interaction
- Tension actions are raw step nudges; they do NOT update
  CUMULATIVE_POSITION (which is angle-based).
- Use small Step Size increments to sneak up on desired preload.

Tips & Safety
- Watch physical tendons while adjusting; avoid over-tightening.
- Near mechanical limits, go slowly and prefer repeated small presses.
- For paired tendons (e.g., antagonists), balance D/T adjustments across
  the pair to maintain neutral posture.
