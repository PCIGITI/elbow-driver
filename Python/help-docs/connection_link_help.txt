<CONNECTION_LINK>

This panel manages the serial link between the GUI and the OpenRB-150.

PORT
- Enter the serial port name (e.g. COM3 on Windows, /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux).
- Default is set in config.

[CONNECT] / [DISCONNECT]
- Connect: opens the serial port and starts communication.
- Disconnect: closes the link cleanly.

STATUS
- Shows current connection state (STANDBY, CONNECTED, etc.).
- Updates automatically when the device connects or drops.

Notes:
- If connection is lost during operation, the GUI will trigger an 
  emergency stop routine, save logs, and prompt you to reconnect.
- Always disconnect before closing the GUI to ensure a clean shutdown.

Note: If the system is unexpectedly disconnected, it may display CONNECTED even though it is disconnecting. In this case, pressing the disconnect button can force reconnection sometimes.
